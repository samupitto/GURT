"The word originated from Justin Timberlake of 'Nsync. The meaning of crunk is multipurposefull. It can mean: a good time 'That party was so crunk !', as a question 'What the Crunk ?!?', description of an object 'That is such a crunk babyblue jacket!', when one is giving up 'Oh man, just crunk it!', to express fondness to another person 'You are the crunkest girl I know.' The act of becoming crunk is to be 'crunktified,' but losing 'crunkness' results in being 'decrunked.' Once 'decrunked,' if proven worthy, one can then 'recrunk' and become crunk again. The possibilities are endless. I would also like to comment that this is no joke. Millions of people know and could recite the exact sentence above (get yo party...) if asked. In the teenybopper vocabulary, this IS, without a doubt, the most important word. Period.",1

My Bad was originally My Bag.  It was common as far back as the 1940s and into 80s.  The origin of this phrase actually comes from the card game Spades.  The player that predicted wrong would say to his partner my bag meaning my fault.  Spades originated in the Midwestern United States in the late 1930s.  It was invented by college students who enjoyed both Whist and Bridge.  The game really took off during WWII.  It spread to factories and offices all across the country.
