Gurt: something very smart, but also very dangerous

Language has always been evolving and it always will, especially since the advent of the internet and social media. We could say that a new, parallel language has developed and it has become more difficult than ever keeping the pace for humans, let alone for machines. 
Some words are used in a different way with a brand new meaning, while some others are totally new. In our work we wanted to focus on this type of informal language, the Slang, that is the one that evolves the most, updating its vocabulary every day.
